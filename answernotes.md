Although we've created an example with artificial data, we think tackling this problem will teach you a number of fundamental data science skills. These include:

* dealing with under-specified questions
* data imports and preprocessing ("data wrangling")
* generating summary statistics using different basis-units

If this last item doesn't make much sense to you, you may be exactly the sort of person who would benefit from working through this challenge.

[detailed work through of a possible analysis of this data, and how it illustrates the importance of understanding different basis units, to come here]
